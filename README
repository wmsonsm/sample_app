#Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Sample application

This is the sample application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutotiral.org) by [Michael Hartl] (http://micahel hartl.com/).

Just a bit of my own. . . . This is killing me! ! ! Can we get an updated version with the newest versions of rails and ruby? ? ? I know things change really quickly but . . . having a hard time with conflicts.
